# minesweeper

# Overview

This is my take on the classic game Minesweeper, written in python. The goal of the game is to clear every square on the board except for those that have bombs underneath. Squares with numbers on them indicate the number of bombs in the 8 squares directly around them. This game provided some unique challenges, such as revealing all adjacent empty spaces when an empty space is clicked. This required a recursive pathfinding algorithm to implement.

I wrote this software because I wanted to learn more about object-oriented programming in python. I have done OOP in C# and C++ but I had never done it in python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.13
* PyGame Library

# Useful Websites
* [Python 3.9 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/)
* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

# Future Work
* Better encapsulate classes and change hard-coded values to constants
* Add win functionality
